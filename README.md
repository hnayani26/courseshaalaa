Our software seeks to provide a platform for students to expand their knowledge and for
professors to teach courses that are relevant to their interests./
For teachers, we provide two types of courses: deployed and working.
Teachers can see and update videos, and students can use videos to learn the course in
greater depth.
Teachers can create assignments and change the course description.
